-->> A slug is a short label for something, containing only letters, numbers, underscores or

hyphens.

-->> They're generally used in URLs.

-->> A slug field in Django is used to store and generate valid URLs for your dynamically created

web pages.

We were new to Django.Firstly, we learned Django in a week then we started the project from

scratch .

In the first and second week of the project , we build the basic features such as

1. All posts list view. ( Home Page)

2.Editing the post page for every post.

3.Creating the post page for every page.

4.Deleting any post.In the third that is the final week of the project we added,

5.We added the comment feature to every post by using the Facebook Comment Plugin.

6.We also added the Like share feature using the Facebook Plugin.

7.Then we changed the editor of creating the post to the markdown text editor.

8.We then added the Slug feature to map the urls to the corresponding posts.

9.Then I added the User Authentication System to the Forum.

10.An additional comment section was also added to each post which can only be used by the

authorised user.

11.Unauthorised user can only comment on the posts through the Facebook Comment Plugin.

12.Finally,we created the user page for each user on which he or she can see the posts created by

himself.
